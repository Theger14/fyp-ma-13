  abstract = {The Agile methods favours more communication, continuous integration, rapid delivery of software modules, iterative and incremental approach, but at the same time Agile software development has limitations like lack of upfront planning, lack of sufficient documentation, lack of predictability, etc.. Sometimes these limitations and so many methods make Agile software development more stressful. This work is about finding the current limitations and advantages of Agile software development. For finding the actual limitations beyond the literature, an online survey was conducted with the specified sample size of Agile experienced professionals, then the ANOVA test is applied to satisfy the hypothesis.}

  abstract = {Procedural models for project management can be differentiated into plan-driven methods which follow a classical waterfall process and agile methods which follow an iterative, test-driven approach. This paper answers the following research questions: What are the differences, benefits, and constraints of these two approaches from a practitioner’s point of view? How can a decision model be set up to select the most appropriate approach for a concrete project? This study develops a decision model for the selection of a procedural model for project management which is based on the modelling process described by Adam (1996). The research gap was identified based on a systematic and comprehensive analysis of the literature following Vom Brocke et al. (2009), which reflects the state-of-research. Insights gained were compared with empirical data from 15 expert interviews across different industries in Germany. The presented model systematically supports the selection of an appropriate procedural model for a concrete project based on 15 criteria subsumed under the following categories: scope, time, costs, organization context, and project-team characteristics. It closes a relevant research gap, both from a scientific perspective and from the practitioners’ view. Expert interviews ensure practical relevance and significantly expand the state-of-research with regards to decision support on the project-management approach.}

  abstract = {The Agile project management methodology has been widely used in recent years as a means to counter the dangers of traditional, front-end planning methods that often lead to downstream development pathologies. Although numerous authors have pointed to the advantages of Agile, with its emphasis on individuals and interactions over processes, customer collaboration over contracts and formal negotiations, and responsiveness over rigid planning, there are, to date, very few large-scale, empirical studies to support the contention that Agile methods can improve the likelihood of project success. Developed originally for software development, it is still predominantly an IT phenomenon. But due to its success it has now spread to non-IT projects. Using a data sample of 1002 projects across multiple industries and countries, we tested the effect of Agile use in organizations on two dimensions of project success: efficiency and overall stakeholder satisfaction against organizational goals. We further examined the moderating effects of variables such as perceived quality of the vision/goals of the project, project complexity, and project team experience. Our findings suggest that Agile methods do have a positive impact on both dimensions of project success. Further, the quality of the vision/goals is a marginally significant moderator of this effect. Implications of these findings and directions for future research are discussed.}
