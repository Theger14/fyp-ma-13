# Case 1: Project Selection and Developing a Business Case

## Overview

In this case study, we will perform two separate tasks: project selection and developing a business case. In Task 1, we perform project selection after evaluating multiple projects using the weighted scoring model. Following this in Task 2, we develop a business case for the project that we select in Task 1.

## Task 1: Project Selection

In this task, we apply the weighted scoring model to evaluate four projects and determine which project to choose. The projects are as shown in Table 1.1.

\begin{center}
\begin{tabular}{ | c | p{0.85\linewidth} | } 
\hline
Project & Name \\ 
\hline
1 & FIT3161\_Ting\_Automatic Identification of Autism Spectrum Disorder from Brain Networks Using Graph Deep Learning \\ 
\hline
2 & FIT3161\_MeeChin\_Online Forum Analytics\_3 topics\\ 
\hline
3 & FIT3161\_Raphael\_When Machines learn Crypto \\ 
\hline
4 & FIT3161\_Mei Kuan\_Gender Bias AI \\ 
\hline
\end{tabular}
\end{center}

\begin{center}
\text{Table 1.1: The projects to evaluate}
\end{center}

We will apply the following criteria to evaluate the projects in Table 1.1.

\begin{center}
\begin{tabular}{ | p{0.2\linewidth} | p{0.76\linewidth} | } 
\hline
Criteria & Description \\ 
\hline
Knowledge of topic & Knowledge of topic refers to the familiarity and awareness of the concepts associated with the project topic. A higher level of knowledge indicates a greater level of understanding of the fields related to the topic. \\ 
\hline
Social impact & Social impact refers to the change to address a pressing social challenge. A higher social impact indicates that the project can lead to a more positive change to society. \\ 
\hline
Technical ease & Technical ease refers to the level of easiness for the technical aspect of the project. A higher technical ease indicates that the project is easier to be implemented. \\ 
\hline
Project flexibility & Project flexibility refers to the degree of freedom that the project team has in determining the direction of the project. A higher level of project flexibility indicates that the project is more open-ended, allowing more room for exploration. \\ 
\hline
\end{tabular}
\end{center}

\begin{center}
\text{Table 1.2: The criteria used to evaluate the projects}
\end{center}

\newpage

Using the criteria shown in Table 1.2, we have evaluated the projects in Table 1.1 as shown in Table 1.3.

\begin{center}
\begin{tabular}{ | l | c | c | c | c | } 
\hline
Criteria & Project 1 & Project 2 & Project 3 & Project 4 \\ 
\hline
Knowledge of topic & Low & Medium & Low & High \\ 
\hline
Social impact & High & Low & Medium & Very high \\ 
\hline
Technical ease & Medium & High & Very low & Medium \\ 
\hline
Project flexibility & Low & High & Medium & High \\ 
\hline
\end{tabular}
\end{center}

\begin{center}
\text{Table 1.3: The evaluation of each project}
\end{center}

###### 

We will now design a scoring system for each criterion.

### Scoring system

For each criteria, we will assign a score as shown in Table 1.4:

\begin{center}
\begin{tabular}{ | c | c | } 
\hline
Rating & Score \\ 
\hline
Very high & 10.0 \\ 
\hline
High & 7.5 \\ 
\hline
Medium & 5 \\ 
\hline
Low & 2.5 \\ 
\hline
Very low & 0.0 \\ 
\hline
\end{tabular}
\end{center}

\begin{center}
\text{Table 1.4: The scoring system}
\end{center}

This scoring system will be consistently applied across all criteria.

This leads to the weighted scoring model as shown in Table 1.5.
