### Documentation (Include any justification and assumptions made)

These requirements were raised in the project team meetings, which also involved the project supervisor. The initial requirements were given by the project supervisor, and each team member added more requirements according to their expectations of the project.

An assumption made is that the AI face recognition model will be made open source for public use after the completion of the project, where developers will be able to incorporate the model into their own applications. This assumption leads to several additional requirements documented above, such as APIs for various programming languages and developer documentation. These additions will result in increased accessibility of the AI face recognition model developed in this project.

Further requirements may be added during the course of this project.
